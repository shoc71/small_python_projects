For example, Langer (1989) examined the percentages of respondents who agreed with the following three statements regarding affirmative action that were included on separate attitude surveys:  The percentages of “agree” responses to the three questions varied dramatically, with 74% agreeing to the first, 21% to the second, and 56% to the third. These differences in agreement are quite substantial and may be at the extreme end of what would be expected on the basis of wording changes alone. However, they are indicative of the sensitivity of such questions to choice of language. In the following sections, I explore some of the theories that have been advanced for such sensitivities. First, however, I discuss three common formats for noncognitive items and their uses. I then consider theories that attempt to explain how people respond to noncognitive questions. I close this chapter by considering issues in noncognitive measurement. Some of these relate to so-called response sets, such as the tendency of respondents to provide responses they feel are socially desirable rather than honestly reporting their affective states. Others have to do with more practical issues, such as how many response categories should be included and how to label them.
